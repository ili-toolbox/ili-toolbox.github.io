`ili is a toolbox for 2D and 3D molecular mapping.

`ili is being developed mainly by [Alexandrov Team](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/index.html) at EMBL Heidelberg ([contact information](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/contact/index.html)).

* Developers: Ivan Protsyuk, Sergey Ryazanov
* External collaborators:
  * Members of [Knight lab](http://knightlab.ucsd.edu): Antonio Gonzalez, Jamie Morton, Jose Navas, Yoshiki Vázquez Baeza
* Principal investigator: Theodore Alexandrov 


## Hello bee

For a demonstration, open
* [3D human skin metabolome example](http://ili-toolbox.github.io/?human/man.stl;human/man_LCMS_small.csv) from [the PNAS paper](#miscellaneous); zoom out by using the mouse wheel to see the full image and follow [instructions](#how-to-use-it)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="img/screenshot_human.png" alt="Screenshot of the human example" width="500"/>

* [3D bee example](http://ili-toolbox.github.io/?bee/model.stl;bee/intensities.csv) (data provided by Yi Zeng from the Dorrestein Lab, UCSD); follow [instructions](#how-to-use-it)

* [2D 3dmassomics visualisation example](http://ili-toolbox.github.io/?3dmassomics/bg.png;3dmassomics/intensities.csv) (a photo made during the 3D-MASSOMICS project meeting with simulated spots overlaid); zoom out by using the mouse wheel to see the full image and follow [instructions](#how-to-use-it)

## Installation

The best ways of running `ili are either [from this website](http://ili-toolbox.github.io/) or as a [Chrome extension](https://goo.gl/3KAA8U).

## Input

`ili takes two files:
* for 2D mapping: a PNG to be used as the background image ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ili-toolbox/ili/master/data/3dmassomics/bg.png)), and a mapping file with intensities and coordinates in CSV format ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ili-toolbox/ili/master/data/3dmassomics/intensities.csv))
* for 3D mapping: a binary STL of the 3D model ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ili-toolbox/ili/master/data/bee/model.stl)), and a mapping file with intensities and coordinates in CSV format ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ili-toolbox/ili/master/data/bee/intensities.csv))

To create a mapping file suitable for input, you need two pieces of information: coordinates of your samples on your picture/model and intensities of features you're going to visualize in \`ili. Please find the instruction on how to create a CSV table with coordinates [here](https://github.com/alexandrovteam/Optimus/blob/master/Obtaining coordinates of sampling spots.md). Rows of the result table correspond to samples. Once you have it, you can add your features as new columns. Finally, you need to save it as a CSV file, and it is ready to be viewed in \`ili. Refer to the examples above to have an idea of the final look of the table.

## Cartographical snapshots

\`ili facilitates reproducible data analysis by providing the feature of cartographical snapshots: a complete copy of all visualization settings saved to a file. The file can be reused later or shared with other users, who, afterwards, will be able not only to recover the same view, but also use it as a starting point for further analysis.

The cartographical snapshot is a file in JSON format that can be opened in \`ili using drag&drop along with corresponding files of 3D model/image and spatial mapping.

## Demo

You can find a list of ready-made examples in the "Examples" tab in the \`ili sidebar. Click on any of them, and necessary files will be loaded to the app automatically.

## How to use it?

One of the fundamental ideas behind the `ili interface is the simplicity of usage. Therefore, most operations can be performed with keyboard shortcuts.

|Action|Shortcut on Windows, Linux|Shortcut on OS X|Alternative|
|------|--------------------------|----------------|-----------|
|Open files|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>|<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>|Drag and drop files to \`ili window. Also, when you just launched \`ili, you can press `Open` button at the center of the window.|
|Switch between molecular maps|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd>|<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>↑</kbd> , <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>↓</kbd>|Click on a name of an active map above a colorbar at the right-bottom corner of an app window and select another map with mouse.|
|Find a molecular map by its name|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>|<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>|Click on a name of an active map above a colorbar at the right-bottom corner of an app window and start typing.|
|Save view as image|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>|<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>|NA
|Save cartographical snapshot|<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>|<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>|NA

Many other controls for adjusting visualization are available in the `ili sidebar. Three main sections there "2D", "3D" and "Mapping" correspond to settings affecting 2D/3D views and colormaps.

Mouse buttons can be used to adjust point of view on a model/picture.

|Action|Mouse button|Views where available|
|------|------------|---------------------|
|Rotate model|Move mouse holding its left button|3D|
|Move image|Move mouse holding its left button|2D|
|Zoom|Rotate mouse wheel|2D, 3D|
|Display spot name|Click at a spot with left button|2D, 3D|
|Move model|Move mouse holding its right button|3D|
|Enable/disable model auto-rotation|Double-click|3D|

## Miscellaneous

* **Why is it called `ili?** `ili in Hawaiian means skin and, among others, surface, area, or cover.
* **How to record videos or screencasts in `ili?** Please use a third-party software, for example ScreenCastify plugin to Chrome
* **How can I cite `ili in my scientific publication?** We haven't published a paper devoted to \`ili yet, so please cite [*Bouslimani et al. (2015) PNAS*](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/E2120.abstract?sid=3ff11025-6bea-4b97-808e-0b4d49b7f837), our publication which motivated us the create and release \`ili.
